# BritishAirwaysDataScienceInternship
This is a repository to keep all the files and also publish my process in completing the internship using Data Analysis

Task 1
Web Scraping and Analysis
This Jupyter notebook contains some code to help show how I was able to complete my virtual internship at British Airways.I was asked to use a package called BeautifulSoup to collect data from the web.Once I am done I will be saving it to my local file called ashesi .csv file and will then start my data analysis.

Data Scraping(Skytrax)
Skytrax is the website I will betaking my data from amd the link will be included for you to visit[https://www.airlinequality.com/search/?search=British+Airways] to get a specific feedback on the review,you can try this[https://www.airlinequality.com/airline-reviews/british-airways].I will be using Python and BeautifulSoup to help me collect all the links to the reviews and then collect the text data on each of the individual review links.I mean programming makes our life better and also increases productivity

EDA stands for "Exploratory Data Analysis." It is an approach to analyzing data sets in order to summarize their main characteristics, often with the help of visual methods. The primary goal of EDA is to understand the data, discover patterns, and identify relationships between variables. Some key aspects of EDA include:

    Data Summarization: EDA involves summarizing the main characteristics of the data, such as central tendencies, spread, and distributions. This can be done using statistical measures like mean, median, standard deviation, and visualizations like histograms and box plots.

    Data Visualization: EDA relies heavily on data visualization techniques. It includes creating various plots and charts to better understand the data, such as scatter plots, bar charts, line graphs, and heatmaps. Visualization helps identify patterns and outliers.

    Data Cleaning: Part of EDA is data cleaning, which involves dealing with missing values, outliers, and errors in the data. Cleaning is essential to ensure the data is reliable for analysis.

    Feature Engineering: EDA can also involve feature engineering, where new variables are created or existing ones are transformed to better represent the underlying patterns in the data.

    Hypothesis Generation: EDA often leads to the generation of hypotheses about the data. Analysts form hypotheses about relationships or trends in the data that can be further tested using statistical methods.

    Identifying Relationships: EDA aims to identify relationships between variables. This includes correlation     analysis to measure the strength and direction of relationships.

    Pattern Detection: EDA helps in identifying patterns in the data, which can be valuable for making predictions or decisions.

EDA is an important first step in any data analysis process, as it provides a foundation for subsequent modeling and statistical analysis. It helps data analysts and scientists gain insights into the data, understand its strengths and limitations, and decide on the most appropriate analysis methods to apply.
